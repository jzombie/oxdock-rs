# coverage.toml maps StepKind variants to the case(s) that must exercise them.
# The runner will:
# - Fail if a new StepKind is added but no case is listed here.
# - Fail if a listed case does not actually contain that StepKind.
# - Allow extra cases (guards, escape checks, etc.) via [extras] without claiming
#   StepKind coverage.
